This core board utilized the RISC-V SOC SG2002. In addition to the on-board eMMC, there are also on-board wireless solution ready for use. The wireless module along with the on-board antenna could provides you the basic WIFI/BLE connection ability.

While the on-board antenna cannot have a good long-range performace, you could also choose to use external antenna with the IPEX connector on-board.

The difference between C1_2002W and C1_2002 is whether there is an onboard WIFI chip. They are from the same PCB design. The difference is that C1_2002 does not attach WIFI module.
